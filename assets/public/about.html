<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Austin Walley. I am 27 years old married with one child. I currently am a CDL truck driver hauling hazardous materials. 
  I have been driving a truck for the last 6 years and have decided that it is not what I want to do for the rest of my life. </p>

<p>I have always been fascinated with technology even from a young age. Although I never knew how the internet worked, it has always peaked my interest.
   I love physically learing how things work and operate such as car engines, and I find the internet just as intriguing.    </p>

<p>My goal is to become a professional software developer/ coder. I believe that this would be an awesome career and a challenging oppurtunity to put my mind to the test.
  I thoroughly enjoy constantly learning new things and figuring out puzzles and I believe if given the chance I could prove I am a hard working and dedicated employee who will do anything it takes to succeed and bring value to the company.
  Thank you for taking the time to learn a little about me and I truly appreciate any oppurtunity that I am given.
